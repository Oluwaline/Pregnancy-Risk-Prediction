**Introduction**


Pregnancy is a profound and transformative experience that marks the beginning of a new life. It is the period during which a woman carries a developing fetus within her uterus, typically lasting about 40 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) to the birth of the baby. This journey is divided into three trimesters, each characterized by distinct stages of fetal development and maternal changes.


    - First trimester(week 1-12)
    - Second trimester (weeks 13-27)
    - Third trimester (weeks 28-40)

Pregnacy comes with various risks and challenges, both for the expectant mother and her unborn child. Predicting and managing these risks is crucial to ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy. This is where the field of data science plays a pivotal role.

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface and API for predicting the risk level of pregnant women using machine learning models. The project utilizes three different models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These models are trained to predict the risk level based on various input features such as age, blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature, and heart rate. 


**Objective**


The primary objective of this project is to practice what has been taught in class by using different machine learning models predicting pregnancy risks.
The specific objective
- Utilize pipelines to simplify and automate the machine learning workflow, connecting various steps to reduce time and effort, enhance data training efficiency, and prevent mistakes.
- Provide an intuitive web interface where users can input their data and receive risk predictions.
- Allow users to choose between different machine learning models for prediction.
- Offer an API for developers to integrate the risk prediction functionality into their applications.
- Ensure that the predictions are accurate and reliable by using well-trained machine learning models.



  **About the Data Set**

The data set was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/maternal-health-risk-data. It is a data set collected from different hospitals, community clinics, maternal health cares through the IoT based risk monitoring system.
